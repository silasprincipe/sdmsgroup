# Time series analysis (moved to 2025-03-26)

## Stuart-Smith et al. (2022)
Changes in fish communities, relate to changes in environmental variables more specific temperature.
Calculated thermal index, interesting because this changes in heat waves or other extreme events. Quick way of analyzing if this area was invaded by tropical species or temperature species. 

Used a GAMM model. Used a random effect for a structure of the dataset (nested location sites). Model the indicator as a function of year. Because of the random effect, can see if the effects are general or site-specific. 

Conclusion: in some places temperature changes but reef thermal index stable, in other places temperature change also meant reef thermal index changes. 

## Analyzing ecological data (Zuur, 2007)
Chapter on time-series analysis. 

Big misconception that common statistical methods cannot be used on time-series analysis. There are some extra steps you need to take, mainly regarding autocorrelation of timepoints. The book shows methods you are familiar with, adapted for time-series. 

Should also check for cross-correlation, might tell you that two variables are super related whereas they are actually both just seasonal. So depending on the scale as well need to take this seasonality in account. 

General least squares regression, a linear regression that takes temporal autocorrelation into account. 

## Extreme events (not entirely sure which paper)

Temperature effects on phytoplankton. Two classes: one with the perfect adaptation, the other one has no adaptation. This is something we need to take into account when modelling species.  

Not necessarily better to use very long time-series, need to take into account, climate change, el nino events, extreme events. The longer the time-series the more noise is in there. 

## Time-series forecasting

Used machine learning. Can use both linear methods or neural networks.
